// DOM events

/**
 * Events are the things that happens inside the browser itself.
 * Forexample: click,submit, load, input etc.
 * We add eventListeners to the different elements for which we want our events to react or listen.
 * For example: If we want to listen the title of a webpage we will attach an event to it to listen to those events. We will also make a callback function that will be called when the event occurs.
