# Promises in Asynchronous JavaScript

## Introduction

<b>Promises</b> are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. <br>
They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create <i>callback hell</i> leading to unmanageable code.
Promises are the ideal choice for handling asynchronous operations in the simplest manner. They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events.

### Benefits Of Promises

- Improves Code Readability
- Better handling of asynchronous operations
- Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
- Better Error Handling

### Four States Of Promises

- <b>fulfilled</b>: Action related to the promise succeeded
- <b>rejected</b>: Action related to the promise failed
- <b>pending</b>: Promise is still pending i.e. not fulfilled or rejected yet
- <b>settled</b>: Promise has fulfilled or rejected
