# Asynchronus JavaScript: Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await

## Table Of Contents

### Introduction

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means only one thing can happen at a time. That is, the JavaScript engine can only process one statement at a time in a single thread. <br>
While the single-threaded languages simplify writing code because you don’t have to worry about the concurrency issues, this also means you can’t perform long operations such as network access without blocking the main thread.<br>
That’s where asynchronous JavaScript comes into play.<br>
<b>Asynchronous JavaScript</b> is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task, and then rather than having to wait until that task has finished, to be able to continue to be responsive to other events while the task runs. Once the task is completed, your program is presented with the result.
