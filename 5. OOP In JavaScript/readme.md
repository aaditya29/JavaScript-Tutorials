# Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript

<b>OOP</b> is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than the functions. However, JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language but a prototype-based langauge, though it still has ways of using object oriented programming (OOP).

> A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object.
