# Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript

<b>OOP</b> is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than the functions. However, JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language but a prototype-based langauge, though it still has ways of using object oriented programming (OOP).

> A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object WHEREAS Class Based Programming is a style of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone.

### Four Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Benefits of OOP

- Encapsulation: Reduce complexity + increases reusability
- Abstraction: Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
- Inheritance: Eliminate redundant code
- Polymorphism: Refactor ugly switch/case statements
